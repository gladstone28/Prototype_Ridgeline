## INTRODUCTION TO UI AND UX DESIGN

### Prototype: Ridgeline

You are working as a user interface designer for an up-and-coming design firm. Previously, you reviewed user research and created low-fidelity wireframes for Ridgeline, a popular outdoor clothing company. The product detail page you rendered in your wireframe was for a colorful, water-resistant, insulated jacket that is constructed with eco-friendly and recycled materials.

After reviewing your low-fidelity wireframe for the product details page, your supervisor approved the design! Your next step is to create high-fidelity wireframes of this design in Figma. Then, you will transform the wireframes into an interactive prototype.

Based on the user research that was completed before your start date, your high-fidelity product details page should include:

Navigation bar
Product name
Product cost
Product description
Available colors
Available sizes
Visual element of the product
“Add to Cart” button
You have the option to also include these elements in your high-fidelity design:

Product reviews
Size chart
Shipping options
“Add to Wishlist” button
Your prototype should allow users to interact with at least two elements on the product details page. You can decide what these interactions will be. Here are a few ideas for how users might interact with the prototype:

View different images of the product.
Select a specific size of the product.
Select the “Add to Cart” button and see a notification appear above the cart icon to indicate that the item was added.
Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve. Be sure to check the hints below the tasks for additional information, Figma tips, and design ideas!
